                <p>Data security is a top priority. This section outlines our obligations when handling information.</p>

                <p>'DATA' means all of the above.</p>
                <p>We use Data to provide Services, mitigate fraud, and improve our systems. We do not provide Personal Data to unaffiliated parties for marketing purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Data Protection and Privacy</strong></p>
                <p>a. Confidentiality: You will protect all Data received via the Services and only use it in connection with this Agreement. Neither party may use Personal Data for marketing without express consent. We may disclose Data if required by legal instruments (e.g., subpoena).</p>
                <p>b. Privacy Compliance: You affirm that you comply with all Laws governing the privacy and protection of the Data you provide to or access through the Services.

You agree that you are responsible for implementing your own firewall, anti-virus, anti-phishing, and other security measures ("Security Controls").

                <p>Neither party will be liable for delays or non-performance caused by events beyond reasonable control, such as utility failures, acts of nature, or war. This does not excuse your obligation to pay fees.</p>
